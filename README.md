ofxDotFrag
=====================================
ofxDotFrag is a collection of ready to use post processing / glitch shaders with this goals:
- Process and renders to `ofFbo`s.
- Cross compatible, works both on openGL and openGL ES
- Fast to use API ( higher level than just using ofShader )
- Shaders made to be used/tweaked in realtime performances
- Easy to write new shader classes

At the moment the shader selection includes:
- Hue/Saturation/Brightness/Contrast
- ThreeTones
- Delay
- EchoTrace
- InvertStrobe
- Mirror
- MirrorAxis
- Turbolence
- FXAA
- Twist
- RadialRemap    

and an `ofx::dotfrag::Live` class for live coding.
