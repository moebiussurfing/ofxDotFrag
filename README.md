ofxDotFrag
=====================================
ofxDotFrag is a collection of ready to use shader with this goals:   
- Cross compatible, works both on openGL and openGL ES
- Fast to use API ( higher level than just using ofShader )
- Shaders made to be used/tweaked in realtime performances
- Easy to write new shader classes 
   
At the moment the shader selection includes:   
- HSB
- ThreeTones
- Delay
- EchoTrace
- InvertStrobe
- Mirror
   
This project is a bit in its alpha state now, but it is stable enough to be used in projects. I will add more shaders depending on the projects i'm working on at the moment. Every contribution is also welcome, it's easy to understand how to implement new shaders by looking at the included ones.
